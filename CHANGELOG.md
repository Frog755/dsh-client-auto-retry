## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Initial public release on npm as `@frog755/dsh-client-auto-retry`.
- Auto-resume interrupted turns: on `turn/end` with `reason.kind ∈ { error, interrupted, max-tokens }`,
  automatically sends 「继续」 to the same session after a configurable grace period.
- No model/provider switching — the plugin only re-prompts the existing session.
- Settings card in **设置 → 通用 → 断联自动重试** (host-side schema via `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`,
  live-applies config).
- Configurable fields: `graceMs`, `cooldownMs`, `maxConsecutive`, `continueText`,
  `scanOnBoot`, `freshMs`, `verbose`.
- Safety guards: cooldown between attempts, max consecutive retries cap, subagent-session
  exclusion, user-message reset.
- Boot-time scan: recovers recently interrupted sessions within a `freshMs` window.
- Robust mux stream handling: RPC-envelope (`{ rpcId, payload }`) and raw-frame compatible,
  auto-reconnect with backoff.
- Bilingual README (中文 + English) with a version-compatibility matrix for other DSH builds.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Error-code classification (skip permanent failures like 401/403, quota/balance errors).
- Browser notifications when the plugin stops for manual intervention.
